# 🚨 EMERGENCY QUALITY GATES - INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION

## **IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED**

To prevent regression and block unstable code from reaching production, implement these **emergency quality gates** immediately:

---

## **1. BUILD QUALITY GATES**

### **TypeScript Compilation**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Must pass before any PR merge
npm run build
# Exit code 0 required - NO COMPILATION ERRORS ALLOWED
```

### **Test Execution**
```bash
# MANDATORY: All tests must pass
npm run test
# Exit code 0 required - NO FAILING TESTS ALLOWED
```

---

## **2. CODE QUALITY GATES**

### **ESLint Zero-Error Policy**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Zero ESLint errors allowed
npm run lint
# Must return 0 errors (warnings acceptable under 50)
```

### **TypeScript Type Safety**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Type checking must pass
npm run typecheck
# Zero type errors required
```

---

## **3. CI/CD PIPELINE GATES**

### **Pre-commit Hooks** (IMMEDIATE SETUP)
```json
{
  "pre-commit": [
    "npm run build",
    "npm run lint --fix",
    "npm run test"
  ]
}
```

### **GitHub Actions Quality Gates**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality-gates.yml
name: Emergency Quality Gates
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: TypeScript Build (BLOCKING)
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: ESLint Check (BLOCKING)
        run: npm run lint
      
      - name: Test Execution (BLOCKING)
        run: npm run test
      
      - name: Type Check (BLOCKING)
        run: npm run typecheck
```

---

## **4. BRANCH PROTECTION RULES**

### **Main Branch Protection** (IMMEDIATE)
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to main branch

### **Required Status Checks**
- TypeScript build success
- ESLint zero errors
- All tests passing
- Type checking success

---

## **5. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW PROTECTION**

### **Feature Development Block**
⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT**: No new feature development until infrastructure is stable

**Blocked Activities**:
- New agent development
- Feature enhancements
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations (non-critical)

**Allowed Activities**:
- Bug fixes (P0-CRITICAL only)
- Infrastructure repairs
- Security fixes
- Test implementation
- Documentation updates

---

## **6. MONITORING & ALERTING**

### **Build Status Monitoring**
- Slack/Teams notifications for build failures
- Email alerts for CI/CD pipeline failures
- Dashboard for real-time build status

### **Quality Metrics Tracking**
- ESLint error count trending
- Test coverage percentage
- Build success rate
- Time to fix broken builds

---

## **7. EMERGENCY ROLLBACK PROCEDURES**

### **If Quality Gates Fail**
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Revert problematic changes
2. **Block**: All deployments until gates pass
3. **Alert**: Development team of quality gate failure
4. **Fix**: Address issues before any new changes

### **Escalation Path**
- Level 1: Development team (immediate)
- Level 2: Team lead (15 minutes)
- Level 3: Technical director (30 minutes)

---

## **8. IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**

### **Immediate (Next 2 Hours)**
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Block feature development
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure Slack/Teams notifications

### **Within 24 Hours**
- [ ] Implement monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Set up automated alerts
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Train team on new quality gates

### **Within 48 Hours**
- [ ] Validate all quality gates working
- [ ] Create quality metrics dashboard
- [ ] Establish daily quality reviews
- [ ] Document emergency procedures

---

## **ENFORCEMENT POLICY**

**ZERO TOLERANCE**: Any attempt to bypass quality gates results in:
1. Immediate PR rejection
2. Required quality gate compliance training
3. Escalation to technical leadership

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- 100% build success rate
- Zero ESLint errors in production
- >80% test coverage maintained
- All CI/CD pipelines green

---

**🚨 CRITICAL**: These quality gates are **NON-NEGOTIABLE** until infrastructure stabilization is complete. Any violations must be addressed immediately before proceeding with development work.

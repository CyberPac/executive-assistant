# Personal Executive Assistant - Phase 2 Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deploying Phase 2 to CyberPac/executive-assistant

### Prerequisites
- Access to CyberPac/executive-assistant repository
- Git configured with push permissions
- Node.js 20+ installed

### Step 1: Backup Current Repository
```bash
cd /path/to/CyberPac/executive-assistant
git checkout -b backup-pre-phase2
git push origin backup-pre-phase2
```

### Step 2: Copy Phase 2 Files

Copy these files from this codespace to your repository:

**Core Files:**
```bash
# Main application files
src/index.ts                           # Main coordinator
agents/cultural-intelligence/index.ts  # Cultural Intelligence Agent
agents/travel-logistics/index.ts       # Travel Logistics Agent
agents/financial-management/index.ts   # Financial Management Agent
agents/crisis-management/index.ts      # Crisis Management Agent

# Configuration
package.json                          # Dependencies and scripts
tsconfig.json                        # TypeScript configuration

# Documentation and Demo
README.md                            # Updated README
demo.ts                              # Phase 2 demonstration
DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md                  # This file
```

### Step 3: Update Repository Structure
```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p agents/{cultural-intelligence,travel-logistics,financial-management,crisis-management}
mkdir -p src
mkdir -p tests

# Copy files (you'll need to copy the actual content)
# Copy each .ts file from this codespace to the repository
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 5: Build and Test
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the demo to verify everything works
npx tsx demo.ts
```

### Step 6: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .

### üö® P0 CRITICAL (Fix Today - Blocking Production)
1. **TypeScript Compilation Failure** - CI/CD pipeline completely broken
2. **Test Coverage Crisis** - 2% coverage = catastrophic production risk  
3. **Build System Parameter Error** - `tsc --noEmit 2` parsing failure
4. **GitHub Actions Pipeline Failure** - Quality gates non-functional

### üî• P1 HIGH (This Week - Architecture & Performance)
5. **Oversized Component Refactoring** - 4 files >1000 lines require modularization
6. **Missing Cultural Intelligence Modules** - Dependency resolution needed
7. **Memory Leak Prevention** - Agent system optimization required  
8. **Agent Communication Pattern Fixes** - PEAAgentBase inheritance issues

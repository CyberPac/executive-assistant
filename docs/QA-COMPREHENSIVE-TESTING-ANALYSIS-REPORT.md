### 1. Test Infrastructure Enhancements
```typescript
// Implement standardized mock factory pattern
export class StandardizedMockFactory {
  static createMCPIntegration(): MockMCPIntegration {
    return {
      memoryUsage: jest.fn(),
      invokeFunction: jest.fn(),
      storeMemory: jest.fn(),
      // ... complete interface implementation
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Organization Best Practices
- Implement test grouping by feature domains
- Establish consistent test naming conventions
- Create reusable test utilities and fixtures
- Implement proper test isolation strategies

### 3. Coverage Monitoring
```javascript
// Enhanced Jest configuration for coverage tracking
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 85,      // Increase from 80%
    functions: 85,     // Increase from 80%
    lines: 85,         // Increase from 80%
    statements: 85     // Increase from 80%
  }
}
```

### 4. Quality Gates Implementation
- Pre-commit hooks for linting and type checking
- Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage regression prevention
- Security test automation

### 5. Performance Testing Strategy

- Monitor performance metrics in CI/CD

## Test Pyramid Analysis

```
         /\
        /E2E\      ← NEEDS EXPANSION (2 files)
       /------\
      /Integration\ ← LIMITED COVERAGE (2 files)
     /----------\
    /   Unit     \ ← STRONG FOUNDATION (16 files)
   /--------------\
```

**Recommendations:**

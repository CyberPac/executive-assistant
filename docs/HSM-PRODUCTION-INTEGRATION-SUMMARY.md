  - Comprehensive audit trails with integrity hashing
  - Real-time security alerting
  - Log encryption and rotation
  - Suspicious activity detection

### 6. **Production Configuration Framework**
- **Location**: `/src/security/hsm/config/production-hsm-config.ts`
- **Environments**:
  - Executive production configuration
  - High-availability multi-region setup
  - Development simulation mode
  - Compliance-specific configurations (SOX/HIPAA/PCI-DSS)

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Mock Dependencies Eliminated

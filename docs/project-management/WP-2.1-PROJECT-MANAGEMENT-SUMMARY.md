## üéØ PROJECT SCOPE & OBJECTIVES

### **Primary Objective**
Transform mock security implementation into production-ready, enterprise-grade security architecture with Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration and quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

### **Key Scope Elements**
- **HSM Integration**: Production-grade hardware security module interface
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, SPHINCS+
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Continuous verification and risk-based access control

### **Out of Scope**
- Physical HSM hardware procurement (development uses simulation)
- Network infrastructure changes beyond application layer
- Third-party security tool integrations (beyond APIs)
- Legacy system migration (focus on new LEASA v2.0 only)

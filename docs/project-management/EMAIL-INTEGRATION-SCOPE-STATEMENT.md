# Email Integration Module - Project Scope Statement
**Project**: Personal Executive Assistant Email Integration  
**Issue Reference**: GitHub Issue #36  
**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Project Manager**: Development Team Lead  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Project Justification
The Personal Executive Assistant (PEA) system currently lacks functional email integration capabilities, representing a 0% implementation of a core executive assistant requirement. The original baseline specifications explicitly define email integration as fundamental functionality, including Gmail/Outlook API integration with intelligent filtering and priority scoring.

### 1.2 Project Objectives
**Primary Objective**: Implement comprehensive email integration module that enables the PEA system to access, process, and intelligently manage executive email communications across multiple platforms.

**Strategic Alignment**: This project directly addresses the critical gap between current system capabilities (25% baseline completion) and executive assistant requirements, specifically targeting email processing as the #1 missing functionality.

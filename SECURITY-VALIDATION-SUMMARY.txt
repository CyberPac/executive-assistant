WP-2.1 SECURITY VALIDATION SUMMARY
==================================

METRICS ANALYSIS COMPLETE:
✅ Response Time: 6.4ms (Target: <75ms) - EXCEEDS by 1,072%
❌ Security Coverage: 14.26% (Target: 95%) - CRITICAL GAP of -80.74%  
❌ Threat Detection: 5min (Target: <1s) - MISSES by -299 seconds

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
✅ 17,438 lines of security code implemented
✅ 24 security implementation files  
✅ Post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber/Dilithium)
✅ HSM production interface with multi-vendor support
✅ 55/55 security tests passing (OWASP Top 10 compliance)
❌ 6/22 HSM integration tests failing

CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Address security coverage gap (14.26% → 95%)
2. Implement real-time threat detection (<1s)
3. Fix failing HSM integration tests  
4. Complete production HSM validation

DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION:
🔴 BLOCKED - Critical gaps require immediate remediation
